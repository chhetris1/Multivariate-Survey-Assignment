## Part A: Logistic Regression
 
For the logistic regression analysis, you will be employing a list-wise deletion approach to handling missing data (which is also what logistic regression does by default). You will be using the following five variables in your analysis: Sex, Marital, Health, Unhappy, and Depression.

```{r loading, include = TRUE}
library(haven)
df <- read_sav("GSS2018_HW3A.sav")
head(df, 10)
```

### Q.N. 1
How many participants have complete data on these five variables? What percentage is this of the full sample? 

```{r Q.N. 1}
nrow(df)
sum(complete.cases(df))
df$complete_case <- complete.cases(df)

```
Out of total 2348 observations in the datafile, 708 are complete cases. It is `r 708/2348*100` percent of the full sample. 

### Q.N. 2
```{r Q.N. 2}
test_sex <- chisq.test(table(df$Sex, df$complete_case)) 
test_sex
test_marital <- chisq.test(table(df$Marital, df$complete_case))
test_marital
test_Health <- chisq.test(table(df$Health, df$complete_case))
test_Health
test_unhappy <- chisq.test(table(df$Unhappy, df$Depression))
test_unhappy
test_depression <- chisq.test(table(df$Depression, df$complete_case))
test_depression
```
Sex, Marital, Health, and Depression variables each do not seem to predict the distribution of missingness in the dataset. But Unhappy variable seems to predict the distribution of missingness in the dataset. 

### Q.N.3
```{r complete case subset  }
dfc <- df %>% filter(complete_case)
head(dfc, 10)
nrow(dfc)
summary(dfc)
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
hist(dfc$Sex)
hist(dfc$Marital)
hist(dfc$Unhappy)
hist(dfc$Depression)
```
